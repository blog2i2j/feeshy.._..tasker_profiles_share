# tasker_profiles_share

-- sharing my frequently used tasker profiles

## Brief Guide

Make sure you are at the homepage of this repository.

Each profile is located in a specific directory.

In a directory, there is always a ```readme.md``` for brief descriptions.

After reading it, you can download the ```*.prf.xml``` or ```*.tsk.xml``` file in the same directory-- This is what you are going to import to your tasker.

There may be some other additional files, for instance, screenshots. Discover them by yourself.
